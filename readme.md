# Code Olympics 2023 - Team 16 - C# Projects
This repo stores all the projects we're submitting in C# .NET

## Building
These projects can be built in .NET6 and above in VS2022 (or msbuild).

In Visual Studio, open the solution and set the active project you want to build (right click on the project in the 
Solution Explorer and click 'Set as Startup Project'). Press F5 to start the application. Note that the application will 
behave differently in the Debug build configuration, see the source code for details.
